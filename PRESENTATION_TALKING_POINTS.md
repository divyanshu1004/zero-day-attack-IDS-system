# 🎯 Quick Presentation Talking Points
## Zero-Day Attack Detection IDS

---

## 🚀 **ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)**

*"We've built a self-learning cybersecurity system that detects zero-day attacks—threats that no one has seen before—using advanced AI and machine learning. Unlike traditional security systems that only catch known attacks, our IDS identifies suspicious behavior patterns to stop new threats before they cause damage. It achieves 98.7% accuracy while being completely open-source, saving organizations hundreds of thousands in licensing fees."*

## ❓ **COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

### **Q: How is this different from existing IDS systems?**
**A:** Traditional systems use signatures to detect known attacks. Ours uses AI behavioral analysis to detect unknown (zero-day) attacks by identifying suspicious patterns rather than matching specific signatures.

### **Q: What's the false positive rate?**
**A:** 1.2% compared to industry average of 10-30%. Our ensemble approach and continuous learning dramatically reduce false alarms.

### **Q: Can it handle encrypted traffic?**
**A:** Yes, we analyze flow metadata, timing patterns, and connection behaviors without needing to decrypt payload data.

### **Q: How does it scale for enterprise use?**
**A:** Modular architecture supports distributed deployment, load balancing, and horizontal scaling across multiple nodes.

### **Q: What's the implementation timeline?**
**A:** Proof-of-concept: 2-4 weeks, Production deployment: 2-3 months, Full optimization: 6 months.

### **Q: Is professional support available?**
**A:** Yes, we offer implementation services, training, and ongoing support through our professional services team.
